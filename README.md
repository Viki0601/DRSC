Dimensionality Reduction Using K-Means Algorithm
ðŸ“Š Simplify High-Dimensional Data for Better Analysis

Overview
Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in processing and analyzing high-dimensional datasets. This project leverages the K-Means Algorithm for clustering-based dimensionality reduction, enabling better visualization, faster computations, and improved data insights.

By reducing datasets to lower dimensions (2D or 3D), this project aims to preserve the intrinsic structure of the data while simplifying its complexity, making it easier to interpret patterns and relationships.

Features
Dimensionality Reduction: Uses K-Means clustering to group data into clusters and reduce dimensions.
Visualization: Generates clear and interactive 2D and 3D plots for easy pattern recognition.
Scalable: Works with datasets of varying sizes and dimensions.
Preprocessing: Supports data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare datasets for reduction.

Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language for implementation.
Libraries:
scikit-learn: For clustering and machine learning utilities.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.

How It Works
Input:

Accepts high-dimensional datasets as input (e.g., .csv files).
Example: Customer data, stock market data, or any numerical dataset.
K-Means Clustering:

Groups data into clusters based on similarity.
Cluster centroids are used to map the data into lower dimensions.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Reduces the dataset to 2D or 3D coordinates for visualization.
Visualization:

Generates scatter plots to show clustering patterns and relationships between data points.
